For internal server error see the gunicorn log at frappe-bench/logs/frappe.log

First, stop mariadb sudo service mysql stop
Then create the file, add the variable
Then restart mariadb sudo service mysql start

Either the frappe-bench/logs or /var/log/ should have details of your case.

RAM usage (htop)

Redis cache memory allocation (10% of RAM)

How to increase Innodb Pool Buffer size?
The best way to make changes to variables is to create your own cnf file. This way, things won't get overwritten during any Ubuntu, MariaDB, or ERPNext update.

I recommend making a new .cnf file in /etc/mysql/conf.d and making the change in there.

First, stop mariadb sudo service mysql stop
Then create the file, add the variable
Then restart mariadb sudo service mysql start

Increase memory in redis_cache.conf
where can i find " redis cache " so i can change the value for it.
frappe@erpnext:~/frappe-bench$ find . -name *.conf | xargs grep 'maxmemory'
./config/redis_cache.conf:maxmemory 50mb
./config/redis_cache.conf:maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

Redis Configuration Changes( do only if requires): 
With the following changes CPU usage reduced from constant 100% to 10% and system started working fine.

May do the following two changes in file:/etc/redis/redis.config if not done and restart system.

VERY EASILY UPDATE ERPNEXT data to current ~v11
login to mariadb using

mysql -u root -p database-name;

ensure you start at the folder where you uploaded the database or at least know its location. if you don’t know the erpnext db name, then use

mysql -u root -p mysql;

then type

show databases;

at the prompt (include the ; ) then see your erpnext db name; now type

use erpnext-database-name.

Then type

source /home/frappe/frappe-bench/dbbackup.sql.

Mysql nicely and very quickly imports everything in your backup; replacing tables in your fresh database.
6. Your site will now have Internal Server Error: :joy: :smiling_imp: so yes! all good. Now you need to update so the database is fixed. Type banch update. If the update tells you there are changes that need to be committed or discarded (you have modifications); then do

bench update --reset (also you can use git stash against the frappe and erpnext folders at the prompt).

Now things begin to update. You will have errors like NULL issues on some tables, some patches will fail; I personally skip them if I look at them and can live without them; others usually are columns issues in tables which you can alter (POST PROBLEMS ON THIS THREAD AND YOU WILL GET HELP because we can’t know which exact tables may give you issues). I had one with apply_user_permission cannot be null, which I solved with this thread

Automatically stop the server
run this command first then try to bench start
