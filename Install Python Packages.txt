This can help you:

Option 1: Install in the virtual environment

sudo ./env/bin/pip install pandas
Option 2: Activate virtual environment from frappe-bench

source env/bin/activate
and

pip install pandas
To return

deactivate

------------------------------
You simply need to activate the virtualenv at ~/frappe-bench/env/bin

Hi All, I did the following

Thanks for your help.
