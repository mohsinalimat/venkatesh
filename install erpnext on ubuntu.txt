how to install erpnext on ubuntu
This guide is based on https://github.com/frappe/bench, and is tested a couple of times against ubuntu 14.04/64.

Login as root with ssh.
Optionally:
apt-get update

apt-get upgrade

dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

apt-get install nano
Add a user (erpnext for our example).
adduser frappe
Store password in a safe place for later use.

visudo (to grant erpnext user sudo privileges, by copying root record)
A nice article on user management: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-and-delete-users-on-an-ubuntu-14-04-vps

Login as frappe.
su frappe
Download script at home dir and execute it.
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/bench/master/playbooks/install.py
sudo python install.py --production --user frappe
sudo python install.py --production --version 11 --user frappe

sudo python install.py --production --user frappe --frappe-branch v11.x.x --erpnext-branch v11.x.x
You will prompted for mysql and admin passwords.
Store both passwords in a safe place for later use.

The script is going to take some moments to complete depending on hardware, let’s say 5 or 10 minutes.

Restart web server, sudo service nginx restart.
Fire up your browser and point to your server’s IP (or hostname). If everything goes well you will see eprnext login screen. Use your stored admin pass to access web app. Eventually a nice setup wizard will show up at your browser.
You’re amost done. To increase security you should install ssl. We’ll use let’s encrypt for our example.

su erpnext
cd ~
cd frappe-bench
Important! Assuming your domain is example.com: mv sites/site1.local sites/example.com
nano sites/example.com/site_config.json
Add "host_name": "https://example.com",
Don’t forget commas separating json records.

Enable dns multitenancy: bench config dns_multitenant on
Regenerate nginx config: bench setup nginx
Reload nginx: sudo service nginx reload
Configure let’s encrypt: sudo -H bench setup lets-encrypt example.com
If errors occur, recheck all your steps. If https/ssl still fails, try the manual method below.

updating bench from v11(master)

$ cd / home/frappe/frappe-bench/apps/erpnext
$ git config remote.upstream.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*"

$ bench switch-to-branch version-11 frappe erpnext
$ bench update

----------------------
1
sudo passwd ubuntu
sudo service sshd restart



su root
cd /opt
wget https://certbot.eff.org/
sudo service nginx stop
./opt/certbot-auto certonly --standalone
su erpnext
cd ~/frappe-bench/sites/example.com
nano sites/example.com/site_config.json
Add two lines, beware of the commas separating json records! "ssl_certificate": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem",
"ssl_certificate_key": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem"
, save and exit nano
bench setup nginx, to regenerate cofig files.
sudo service nginx restart
Now, you should be ok with letsencrypt cert. Letsencrypt certificate expires every three months, so you’d better set up a cronjob that automatically renew certificate. It should be as easy as adding a crontab entry.

crontab -e
Add this: # renew letsencrypt certificates on 1st monday of every month and get an email if it gets executed
MAILTO="mail@example.com"
0 0 1-7 * * [ "$(date '+\%a')" = "Mon" ] && sudo service nginx stop && /opt/certbot-auto renew && sudo service nginx start
You’re done
VERY EASILY UPDATE ERPNEXT data to current ~v11
login to mariadb using

mysql -u root -p database-name;

ensure you start at the folder where you uploaded the database or at least know its location. if you don’t know the erpnext db name, then use

mysql -u root -p mysql;

then type

show databases;

at the prompt (include the ; ) then see your erpnext db name; now type

use erpnext-database-name.

Then type

source /home/frappe/frappe-bench/dbbackup.sql.

Mysql nicely and very quickly imports everything in your backup; replacing tables in your fresh database.
6. Your site will now have Internal Server Error: :joy: :smiling_imp: so yes! all good. Now you need to update so the database is fixed. Type banch update. If the update tells you there are changes that need to be committed or discarded (you have modifications); then do

bench update --reset (also you can use git stash against the frappe and erpnext folders at the prompt).

Now things begin to update. You will have errors like NULL issues on some tables, some patches will fail; I personally skip them if I look at them and can live without them; others usually are columns issues in tables which you can alter (POST PROBLEMS ON THIS THREAD AND YOU WILL GET HELP because we can’t know which exact tables may give you issues). I had one with apply_user_permission cannot be null, which I solved with this thread
